    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello! My name is Ashley Ure, and I am a marketing student at Brigham Young University. I have a passion for creating innovative marketing strategies and helping businesses grow their brand presence. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and exploring new cuisines.</p>

    <p class="box1 box2 box3">I am from Leesburg, Virginia, where I have lived the past 6 years. Born and rasied a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, I have loved my Savior my whole life! I was recently called to serve in the Tahiti Papeete mission where I will be speaking both French and Tahitian. I am so excited and grateful to serve my Savior. </p>
